## Description who/what/when/what/why
I created the reactjs portfolio to showcase some of the skills I've picked up along my journey beginning web developement.
With just a week under my belt using reactjs, I'm really excited to see how far this project portfolio has come along, and its been
extremely nice getting to work in CSS again. Some of my initial struggles with react were the component pages and how they were interacting with each other. I still have a lot more to learn with react, but it feels like such a clean language compared to some of my previous projects, it was an enjoyable challenge.

## Features 
This simple, yet effective portiolio allows page viewes to nagivate through about me, projects, contact me, and view/print/download resume. The contact section does send me e-mails through the emailjs app. The resume page is finicky and requires a reload, but should work on page load. 


## Tests 
No tests have been ran.
